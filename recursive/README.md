# Assignment 1: Grid Patterns
This is the coding assignment about grid patterns by [Richard van 't Hof](https://www.therichard.space). This deliverable contains multiple experiments to illustrate the research process. Please only look at the first result for grading if you can't take multiple items into account. The other items may not always comply with the instructions. References for used inspiration or code examples can be found as comments in the source code.

## ðŸš€ How to run
Options:
- View `index.html` using a web serverÂ like you can find in the [VS Code Live Preview plugin](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.live-server).
- Open https://cc.therichard.space/grid-patterns/

## ðŸ“„ Instructions
Create a sketch that generates a different grid-based pattern each time it is run by using either the `random()` function or the `noise()` function, e.g., to choose the positions and types of shapes drawn. 
Marks will be awarded based on technical implementation and visual design. You may use colour and drawing styles, but this is not required.

The examples shown here are based on simple grids, like those you developed in the worksheet exercises, the top one is 20x20 and draws a single diagonal line depending on a conditional test using `random()`, the bottom one is 15x15 and draws two arcs in opposite corners depending on a conditional text using `noise()`.
Note: You are not limited to using square or rectangular grids. If you want to challenge yourself, try creating a triangular or hexangonal grid and using this to draw your pattern.
