# Assignment 4: Simulation
This is the coding assignment by [Richard van 't Hof](https://www.therichard.space). This deliverable contains multiple experiments to illustrate the research process. Please only look at the first result for grading if you can't take multiple items into account. The other items may not always comply with the instructions. References for used inspiration or code examples can be found as comments in the source code.

## ðŸš€ How to run
View `index.html` using a web serverÂ like you can find in the VS Code Live Preview plugin.

## ðŸ“„ Instructions
Create a sketch that uses one or more particle systems.
Consider how you can use particles to produce an interesting visual effect.
You may also use a physics simulation, like the one covered in the lecture this week.

- No reason why a particle system should start from one part of the screen.
- You're also free in how particles should be rendered. Maybe you can use images or text.
