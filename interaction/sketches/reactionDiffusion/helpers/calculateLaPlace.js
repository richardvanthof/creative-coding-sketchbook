# LaPlacian function
Function that takes care of convolution. It takes the values of all cells around the target cell and use that in the calculation.
look at every single cell and apply a weight. We're trying to determine the difference between the cell and it's neighbours.
Some typical values used, for those interested, are: DA=1.0, DB=.5, f=.055, k=.062 (f and k vary for different patterns), and Î”t=1.0. The Laplacian is performed with a 3x3 convolution with center weight -1, adjacent neighbors .2, and diagonals .05. The grid is initialized with A=1, B=0, and a small area is seeded with B=1.
