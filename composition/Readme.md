## Assignment
Create a sketch that uses multiple layers, i.e., multiple graphics contexts, and composite them together to produce a visual that would be impossible (or difficult) without using layers. Explain in comments in your code why your sketch needs layers, or how using layers made your sketch simpler to implement.

> - You are allowed to use shaders, but only if you combine it with graphics contexts.
> - Try to play around with existing shaders from places like [ShaderToys](https://www.shadertoy.com/?theme=default). Look up term like 'glitch' for shaders that can interact with media behind it.
