## Project goal
I aim to develop a tool for generating both static and dynamic typographic graphics for use in graphic design, branding, and motion design projects. While such graphics can be produced using conventional design software such as Adobe Illustrator or After Effects, the process typically requires a significant amount of manual labour. This makes it time-consuming to create multiple variations with different text content or to experiment systematically with parameters and constraints within a specific visual concept. Moreover, these workflows are often unsuitable for interactive contexts, where typographic assets need to be generated dynamically in real time.

Many typographic designs, however, are based on underlying logical rules or natural patterns that can be effectively reproduced through code. Creative coding frameworks such as p5.js make it possible to translate these principles into generative systems. For this reason, design agencies such as [Studio Dumbar](https://studiodumbar.com/work/north-sea-jazz) and [Fabrique](https://www.fabrique.nl/cases/digital-design/lowlands/) frequently develop custom tools that enable designers—and sometimes their clients—to generate dynamic typographic assets on the fly.

With this project, I seek to explore whether I can develop a comparable tool myself and investigate how such a system can be used as a design instrument for creating typography in a poster or publication context.

### Functionality
I aim to add the following features and functionalities to this tool:

- One or more dynamic type designs
- Real-time preview of the graphic.
- Select the current type design concept
- Change the text
- Adjust type design parameters like text size, text colors, position and/or other parameters depending on the visual concept.
- set the export size of the graphic.
- Decide size of canvas.
- export graphic to transparent png (and ideally even svg and mp4) at print quality (300dpi).
- Pan canvas & zoom in and out
