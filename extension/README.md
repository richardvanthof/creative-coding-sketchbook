## 📄 Instructions: do something with sound!
Create a sketch that uses the p5.Sound library in response to either user input, e.g., mouse or keyboard events, or in response to changing variables in a sketch as a result of a simulation. The examples provided with in p5.Sound library reference provide lots of good starting points for interactive sketches. Or you may enhance one of your previous sketches with sound, e.g., create a sketchpad with sound. Just do something with the sound library.
