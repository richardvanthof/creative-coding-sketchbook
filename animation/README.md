Using one or two words from the Toki Pona language (check the [Lipu Linku](https://linku.la/?q=)) (use the words, but you may also use the icons in addition to the words) create a sketch that creates a kinetic text story that illustrates the meaning of the words.
Hint: Think carefully about your choice of font(s) to help express your story and use transformation functions to move, rotate and scale your text. You may use the official symbols for the words chosen.
